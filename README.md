<h1>Reading List Website</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>A family member has started programming a reading list website. The goal is to allow users to create a reading list that shows each books’ title, author, and the number of pages in a table format. Unfortunately, the JavaScript isn’t working the way they imagined and they needed help fixing the JS.</p>

<p>After debugging by using the Console and Problems tabs to guide me through fixing the issues, the working website creates a table with alternate row colors when visitors enter the book title, author, and pages.</p>
